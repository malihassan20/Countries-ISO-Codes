# Countries Databse file containing ISO codes

This is a simple database file which contains the countries list having the following parameters:

1) name,
2) continent,
3) num (three-digit country codes which are identical to those developed and maintained by the United Nations Statistics Division, with the advantage of script (writing system) independence, and hence useful for people or systems using non-Latin scripts),
4) isd,
5) alpha2 (two-letter country codes which are the most widely used of the three, and used most prominently for the Internetâ€™s country code top-level domains),
6) alpha3 (three-letter country codes which allow a better visual association between the codes and the country names than the alpha-2 codes)

You can easily use it in your project by importing this table into your database.
